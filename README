This is a native PHP interface for calling the 140 Proof ad API,
so you don't need to "roll your own" code to implement 140 Proof â€”
just call native PHP code like:

$api = new Api140Proof( "my_cool_app" );
$api_url = $api->getAd( "jm3", "xml" );

and get back an ads to display on your site.

Docs and error-handling are included. Also check out the ruby wrapper
for the API at http://github.com/reddavis/One40proof
